Description:
The initial, black canvas will display the first shape, a blue triangle. A left mouse click will cause
the second shape, a square, to be displayed, another left mouse click will result in the third shape, a
pentagon, to be displayed, and finally another left click will display the first shape, the triangle, again. So every time
there is a left mouse click, the next shape will be displayed.
